# Highlights  
-   To our knowledge, this is the first time that GCN has been used to solve the problem of multi-focus image fusion.
-   Compared with existing methods, FusionGCN provides a new solution for multi-focus image fusion tasks running on devices with limited computing resources.
-   FusionGCN has achieved good results on multiple datasets.
